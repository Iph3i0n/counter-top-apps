# Counter Top App Store

This is the app store for counter top.

More documentation will be added here as the operating system is developed.

If you have an app that you would like to make available to everyone, drop a pull request here and follow the examples already existing. They will need to be tested and code reviewed for quality as this app store is meant to be curated. Or at least it will be, once the operating system is more mature. For now, the reality is that most pull requests will probably be accepted.
